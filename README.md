# `Be-sure-ance`

`Be-sure-ance` is a public-good IFA pre-meeting research tool for source-traceable qualitative metadata on Singapore insurance plans. [`compareFIRST`](https://www.comparefirst.sg/wap/homeEvent.action) remains the reference point for regulated quantitative life-insurance comparison; this project complements compareFIRST with plan-grain qualitative facts that it does not try to curate, such as panel/network clues, exclusions, claim process text, regulatory-event context, and brochure provenance.

The civic value is narrow: reduce brochure-by-brochure manual checking, make stale or changed source material visible, and keep qualitative plan facts traceable to public carrier, MOH, LIA, or MAS sources before any licensed advisory workflow starts. Be-sure-ance does not replace compareFIRST, carrier brochures, or licensed financial advisers.

The app does not provide financial advice, insurance advice, quotes, recommendations, suitability rankings, premium estimates, or cost projections. It is a research workspace for checking source-linked plan facts before using carrier documents, compareFIRST, or licensed advisory workflows.

## Portfolio status

| Signal | Current value | Evidence / caveat |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Supported scheduled carriers | 19 | Test-backed from `src/scrapers/registry.py`; 8 more carriers remain experimental opt-in scrapers. |
| MOH institutions available for panel normalization | 5,305 | Latest local dry-run on 2026-07-02; production refresh still depends on Phase 5 deployment. |
| LIA claim metrics extracted | 12 | Latest local dry-run on 2026-07-02 against fixture/live parser path. |
| Civic carrier canonicalization | Available locally | MAS FID Insurance and LIA member-directory cross-checks produce source-backed canonical names and mismatch flags. |
| Open dataset snapshots | Artifact workflow | Weekly CC-BY-4.0 CSV artifacts export plan facts, source URLs, and verification dates. |
| WCAG 2.1 AA audit | 0 Axe violations / Lighthouse 100 | Local audit on 2026-07-02 covered `/`, `/matrix/panel-hospitals`, `/status`, and one `/share?plans=<refs>` route. See [docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md](./docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md). |
| 30-day lookups | Unavailable | No production Plausible/Umami/privacy-safe analytics deployment is claimed during Phases 1-4. |
| Brochure alerts fired | Unavailable | Brochure history and pending-alert rows exist; no production alert dispatcher is claimed before Phase 5. |

OGP/GovTech tooling scope: Postman.gov.sg email alerts, FormSG stale-data reports, and Go.gov.sg short links were evaluated in [ADR 0007](./docs/adr/0007-defer-ogp-tooling-integrations.md). No integration is currently claimed; each is deferred until public-sector ownership, access, and governance are confirmed.

Cost posture: `$0/mo` target during portfolio validation on Netlify or Cloudflare Pages free tier plus GitHub Actions free tier. Any paid upgrade should be documented here before launch.

## Usage

No production deployment is claimed during Phases 1-4. Phase 5 is the launch gate for restoring Netlify or moving to another static host.
Deployment decision: restore Netlify first; see [deployment runbook](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md). Production URL is not published from this repository yet.
Before any public launch, run the [launch pre-flight](./docs/LAUNCH_PREFLIGHT.md) workflow against staging and record compliance sign-off status.

Sites are refreshed weekly on [SGT Monday 12am](./.github/workflows/refresh-static-data.yml). The scheduled workflow scrapes in GitHub Actions, validates and commits `public/data/app-data.json`, then triggers the Netlify build hook.
The public scraper health dashboard is available at `/status` after the app is deployed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read the [compliance posture](./docs/COMPLIANCE.md) and [legal disclaimer](#legal-disclaimer) before using `Be-sure-ance`.

## Local Docker demo

Run the no-credential local demo:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The default stack starts the Vue frontend and FastAPI PDF backend, then generates seeded static app data. It does not require production credentials and does not deploy anything.

Common local commands:

```sh
docker compose run --rm scraper
PYTHON=.venv/bin/python npm --prefix src/be-sure-ance-app run scrape:data:smoke
PYTHON=.venv/bin/python npm --prefix src/be-sure-ance-app run build:local
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<bot-token> docker compose --profile bot up bot
docker compose down --volumes
```

Keep `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and any observability credentials in local `.env` files or GitHub Actions secrets, not in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Environment variables

Use [`.env.example`](./.env.example) as the local template.

Frontend variables are public and are bundled into the Vue app:

```sh
VITE_STATIC_DATA_PATH=/data/app-data.json
VITE_PDF_BRIEF_ENDPOINT=/briefs/client.pdf
VITE_SITE_ORIGIN=
```

Scraper/backend variables are private and must stay in local `.env` or GitHub Actions secrets:

```sh
BE_SURE_ANCE_DATA_DIR=src/be-sure-ance-app/public/data
NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK_URL=
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
SENTRY_DSN=
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=local
SENTRY_RELEASE=
SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0
```

Netlify only needs `VITE_STATIC_DATA_PATH`, `VITE_SITE_ORIGIN`, optional `VITE_PDF_BRIEF_ENDPOINT`, and optional `VITE_SENTRY_*` variables for frontend-only error reporting.

GitHub Actions uses `NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK_URL` after a valid static-data refresh. The Telegram worker requires `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`. Scraper observability is optional through `SENTRY_DSN`. Never expose `SENTRY_DSN` or `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` through `VITE_*` variables.

## Local checks

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
black --check src tests
ruff check src tests
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
npm --prefix src/be-sure-ance-app ci
npm --prefix src/be-sure-ance-app run lint
npm --prefix src/be-sure-ance-app run format:check
(cd src/be-sure-ance-app && VITE_STATIC_DATA_PATH=/data/app-data.json VITE_SITE_ORIGIN=https://example.com npm run build)
pre-commit run --all-files
uvicorn src.backend.pdf_brief_api:app --reload
```

The FastAPI backend exposes the no-PII PDF endpoint for local development. Production PDF export is served by the Netlify Function at `/briefs/client.pdf`. Share links encode only selected `{insurer, plan_slug}` references in the URL and are not persisted server-side.

Telegram lookup beta:

```sh
python3 -m src.bot.telegram_bot
```

See [Telegram bot beta](./docs/TELEGRAM_BOT.md) for token handling, commands, and deployment notes.

## Static plan pages and sitemap

`npm run build` uses the committed `public/data/app-data.json`, runs Vite, then generates `dist/plan/<insurer>/<plan-slug>/index.html`, `dist/sitemap.xml`, and `dist/robots.txt`. The static page generator reads `plans` and `plan_facts` from the same app-data JSON used by the browser.

Set `VITE_SITE_ORIGIN` to the canonical production origin before Phase 5 launch. Submit `<origin>/sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools only after deployment is restored.
Use [search indexing](./docs/SEARCH_INDEXING.md) to record sitemap pre-flight, Google submission, and Bing submission status.

## Architecture

### Stack

* [Frontend](./src/be-sure-ance-app/) - Vue 3, Vite, static JSON app data, localStorage shortlist state, and URL-only share links.
* [Backend](./src/) - Python scrapers, local JSON table export, FastAPI local PDF endpoint, Netlify PDF Function, and Telegram lookup bot.
* [Static data](./src/lib/static_app_data.py) - build-time exporter for `public/data/app-data.json`.

### DB

```mermaid

    plans {
        int id PK
        text insurer
        text plan_name
        text plan_slug
        text[] plan_benefits
        text plan_description
        text plan_overview
        text plan_url
        text product_brochure_url
        timestamptz scraped_at
    }

    plan_facts {
        int id PK
        text insurer
        text plan_slug
        text field_name
        jsonb field_value
        text source_url
        text source_type
        timestamptz scraped_at
        timestamptz last_verified_at
    }

    specialist_resources {
        int id PK
        text insurer
        text plan_name
        text resource_type
        text resource_url
        text source_url
    }

    plans ||--o{ plan_facts : "insurer + plan_slug"
    plans ||--o{ specialist_resources : "insurer + plan_name"
```

`plans` is the canonical plan catalog. `plan_facts` is the canonical qualitative fact table; each displayed fact carries `source_url`, `source_type`, `scraped_at`, and `last_verified_at`. `plan_comparison_facts` remains an interim qualitative summary table while the frontend completes the Phase 2 migration.

## Details

`Be-sure-ance` only schedules supported scrapers by default. Generic scrapers are experimental, opt-in via `python -m src.scrapers.run_all --include-experimental --only <module>`, and deferred until Phase 2 golden-output tests exist.
